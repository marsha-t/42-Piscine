## The Approaches

<details>
<summary> ### [Approach 1: Copy everything into `write()`](ft_print_alphabet_v1.c) </summary>
This approach simply puts everything that needs to be written into a single `write()` command. It completes the task with very few lines. Just make sure the text is copied correctly and the number of characters to be printed correctly calibrated.

<summary> ### [Approach 2: Use `while` loops](ft_print_alphabet_v2.c) </summary>
This approach uses `while` loops (and more lines of code) to achieve the same.
